**Purpose of this application**  
In China, many old people live alone, because their children or grandchildren are busy working everyday. The old people cannot get enough care from their relatives. They may also feel bored in their daily life. When the old people went out, if they lost their way, it may be difficult for their relatives to find them. And they may face dangerous or sudden illness, if they cannot get in touch with his relatives or hospital, the position can be terrible.   
But everything will be changed by our application. The senior people only need to have a mobile phone with our application installed, then his relatives can track his position at any time. He can also call for help by click the emergency button which shown on screen all the time. The application can also provide some basic information for helpers who come to save the old man in danger. If he feels bored, he can ask the application to play music or opera even radio program for him.  
In a word, our application will keep caring the elder user all the time, as its name "iCare".
